# Entra Connect for hybrid identity 
Microsoft Entra Connect (formerly Azure AD Connect) is a crucial tool for organizations that have a hybrid identity infrastructure, meaning they use both on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID (the cloud-based identity and access management service)
Bridging On-Premises and Cloud: Its primary purpose is to synchronize identity data (users, groups, contacts, and their attributes) between your on-premises Active Directory (AD) and Microsoft Entra ID. This creates a unified identity system across your local network and Microsoft's cloud services

# what is difference between threat detection and threat hunting in sentinel

In Microsoft Sentinel, threat detection and threat hunting are two complementary but distinct activities that are crucial for a robust security strategy. The key difference lies in their approach: threat detection is reactive and automated, while threat hunting is proactive and human-driven.

Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

Threat Detection
Approach: Reactive. It relies on predefined rules, machine learning, and known indicators of compromise (IOCs) to identify malicious activity after it has occurred or is in the process of occurring.


Purpose: To automatically alert security teams to suspicious behavior or known threats. It's the first line of defense that quickly identifies and flags potential security incidents.


Methodology:

Analytics Rules: Microsoft Sentinel uses various types of analytics rules, including scheduled queries, near-real-time (NRT) rules, and machine learning-based rules (like Fusion), to analyze ingested data.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): It uses threat intelligence feeds to automatically look for known malicious IPs, domains, and file hashes.

Predefined Logic: The system is configured with a set of rules and algorithms to detect specific patterns, like a user logging in from an unusual location or a known malware signature.

Human Role: Security analysts monitor the alerts and incidents generated by the system. Their job is to investigate, triage, and respond to these alerts.

Threat Hunting
Approach: Proactive. It's an active, investigative process where a security analyst assumes that an attacker has already bypassed the automated defenses and is hiding in the environment.


Purpose: To uncover previously undetected threats, novel attack methods, and malicious activity that doesn't trigger standard alerts.

Methodology:

Hypothesis-Driven: Threat hunting is not random. It's based on a specific hypothesis, such as "An attacker may be using a new privilege escalation technique on our domain controllers."

Manual Investigation: Threat hunters use powerful querying tools, like Kusto Query Language (KQL) in Sentinel, to manually search through large datasets (logs, network traffic, etc.).

Behavioral Analysis: They look for subtle anomalies and deviations from normal behavior rather than just known attack signatures.

Collaboration and Documentation: The process involves creating bookmarks, documenting findings, and collaborating with the security team.

Human Role: Threat hunting is heavily reliant on the expertise, creativity, and intuition of a skilled security analyst. They must think like an attacker to anticipate and find hidden threats.

Analogy
Threat Detection: Think of a motion-activated security camera with a loud alarm. When it detects motion (a known pattern), it triggers an alert. It's a great initial defense.

Threat Hunting: Think of a detective who, after the alarm has gone off, or even without an alarm, starts a manual investigation. They look for subtle clues that the camera might have missed—like a fresh footprint, a discarded cigarette butt, or a strange sound in the background—to find a hidden intruder.

In a nutshell, threat detection provides the essential, automated foundation for security operations, while threat hunting adds a critical layer of human-led proactive defense to catch the sophisticated threats that automation alone might miss. They are both essential components of a mature security program in Sentinel.

# Sentinel can ingest Defender for Cloud alerts, recommendations, and posture findings. Sentinel also gets all CWP plan alerts (Servers, Containers, Storage, SQL, etc.) after that, what we should do? (2025/08/30)
1. Normalize & Enrich the Data

Map alerts to MITRE ATT&CK tactics/techniques → Sentinel already does this for many Defender alerts. This helps analysts understand attack context.

Enrich with Threat Intelligence (CTI) → integrate threat intel feeds into Sentinel so alerts can be automatically correlated with known malicious IPs/domains/hashes.

Tag by environment or criticality → e.g., tag alerts from Production SQL differently than from Dev workloads.

2. Detection & Correlation

Use Analytics Rules in Sentinel to:

Detect chained activity (e.g., Defender for Servers “malware detected” + Entra ID risky login).

Correlate Defender CWP alerts with other signals (firewall logs, identity anomalies).

Enable Fusion ML in Sentinel → automatically correlates low-severity Defender alerts into high-fidelity incidents.

3. Incident Management

Configure Automation Rules → automatically group related Defender alerts into a single incident.

Prioritize by severity + asset criticality → e.g., a Storage account malware alert on a public-facing blob should escalate faster than one in a dev/test account.

Build Incident Workbooks → dashboards showing live Defender + Sentinel incident stats (open, MTTR, trending attack surfaces).

4. Automated Response (SOAR)

Use Playbooks (Logic Apps) triggered from Defender/Sentinel incidents:

Isolate a VM flagged by Defender for Servers.

Disable an account tied to suspicious Defender for Identity alerts.

Quarantine malicious files in Defender for Storage.

Notify SecOps via Teams/Slack and open a Jira/ServiceNow ticket.

5. Continuous Compliance & Posture Improvement

Export Defender recommendations into Sentinel Workbooks.

Track Secure Score trend over time in Sentinel.

Align Defender recommendations to frameworks (NIST, CIS, FedRAMP) and surface them in compliance dashboards.

Automate alerts when a critical recommendation is still unremediated after X days.

6. Hunting & Threat Analysis

Use Hunting Queries in Sentinel with Defender data:

Find anomalous VM process executions (Defender for Servers).

Detect unusual container startup commands (Defender for Containers).

Spot repeated failed queries against SQL DBs (Defender for SQL).

Store common queries as hunting bookmarks → helps analysts investigate faster.

✅ Summary Workflow

Ingest Defender for Cloud + CWP data → you already did.

Normalize & enrich → MITRE, CTI, tags.

Detect & correlate → scheduled/NRT rules, Fusion ML.

Respond automatically → SOAR playbooks.

Measure & improve → compliance dashboards, Secure Score.

Proactively hunt → build KQL hunting queries for advanced threats.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) Cloud Workload Protection (CWP) is designed to identify and protect against various threats and misconfigurations across your cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP) and hybrid workloads (servers, containers, databases, storage, etc.)
I. Misconfigurations (often leading to security posture recommendations):
These are generally the most common findings, as they represent deviations from security best practices and can often be easily remediated. MDC's Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) component is heavily involved here.

1. Network Misconfigurations:

Overly Permissive Network Security Groups (NSGs)/Security Groups: Ports open to the internet (e.g., RDP, SSH, SQL, databases, web application ports) that should be restricted to specific IPs or internal networks. This is a top attack vector.

Publicly Exposed Storage Accounts: Blob containers or file shares configured for anonymous public read/write access. This can lead to data leakage or malware uploads.

Lack of Just-in-Time (JIT) VM Access: VMs with persistent open management ports (RDP/SSH) instead of using JIT to open them only when needed for a limited time.

Missing or Misconfigured Firewalls: Workloads not protected by a properly configured network firewall.

2. Identity and Access Management (IAM) Issues:

Over-privileged Identities/Accounts: Users, service principals, or managed identities with more permissions than required (Principle of Least Privilege violation).

Unused Accounts/Credentials: Inactive accounts or orphaned credentials that could be exploited.

Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Accounts, especially administrative ones, not enforcing MFA.

Weak Password Policies: No strong password requirements.

3. Compute (VMs, Containers) Misconfigurations:

Missing OS Security Updates/Patches: Servers (Windows and Linux) not having the latest security patches installed.

Missing Endpoint Protection (Antimalware): VMs without an active and up-to-date endpoint protection solution (e.g., Microsoft Defender for Endpoint).

Vulnerabilities in Container Images: Container images with known vulnerabilities (CVEs) found during vulnerability assessments.

Insecure Container Configurations: Containers running with elevated privileges, sharing sensitive host namespaces, or exposing unnecessary ports.

Unencrypted Disks: VM disks (OS and data) not encrypted at rest.

Lack of File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): Not monitoring critical system files and directories for unauthorized changes.

4. Database Misconfigurations:

Missing Database Encryption: Databases not encrypted at rest (e.g., Transparent Data Encryption - TDE).

Weak Authentication to Databases: Using SQL authentication instead of Azure AD authentication.

Missing Auditing/Logging: Database auditing not enabled to track access and activities.

Over-privileged Database Users: Database users with excessive permissions.

5. General Configuration Issues:

Lack of Diagnostic Logging: Critical services not sending diagnostic logs to a central log analytics workspace.

Lack of Encryption for Data in Transit: Services not enforcing TLS 1.2 or higher.

Unmanaged Certificates: Expired or soon-to-expire certificates.

II. Security Alerts (runtime threat detection):

While misconfigurations are proactive, CWP also generates alerts when actual suspicious or malicious activity is detected.

1. Compromised Accounts/Identities:

Brute-force attacks against SSH/RDP.

Unusual login locations or impossible travel.

Attempts to enumerate directory services (e.g., Active Directory).

Credential dumping attempts.

2. Malicious Activity on Servers (VMs):

Malware detection and execution (ransomware, viruses, crypto-miners).

Suspicious process execution (e.g., execution from unusual locations, unsigned binaries).

Abnormal network connections (e.g., communication with known malicious IPs, command and control servers).

Discovery or reconnaissance attempts (e.g., port scanning from within the network).

Privilege escalation attempts.

Suspicious file modifications (e.g., web shell uploads).

3. Container Runtime Threats:

Suspicious activities within containers (e.g., execution of unknown binaries, privileged container deployments, SSH servers in containers).

Attempts to escape containers or gain access to the host.

4. Database Attacks:

SQL injection attempts.

Brute-force attacks against database logins.

Data exfiltration attempts from databases.

Suspicious queries or access patterns.

5. Storage Account Threats:

Malware uploaded to storage accounts.

Detection of compromised Shared Access Signatures (SAS) tokens.

Unusual access patterns to storage (e.g., from unusual locations, IP addresses from Microsoft Threat Intelligence).

Data exfiltration attempts from storage.

Blob-hunting attempts (scanning for publicly exposed storage).

# What is Azure AD Tenant
An Azure AD tenant provides identity and access management (IAM) capabilities to applications and resources used by your organization. An identity is a directory object that can be authenticated and authorized for access to a resource. Identity objects exist for human identities such as students and teachers, and non-human identities like classroom and student devices, applications, and service principles.

The Azure AD tenant is an identity security boundary that is under the control of your organization’s IT department. Within this security boundary, administration of objects (such as user objects) and configuration of tenant-wide settings are controlled by your IT administrators.

# OAuth2 (Open Authorization) workflow
OAuth2 is a standard designed to allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user.OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol and NOT an authentication protocol. As such, it is designed primarily as a means of granting access to a set of resources, for example, remote APIs or user data.

OAuth 2.0 uses Access Tokens. An Access Token is a piece of data that represents the authorization to access resources on behalf of the end-user. OAuth 2.0 doesn’t define a specific format for Access Tokens. However, in some contexts, the JSON Web Token (JWT) format is often used. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36766101/218095716-3ce416d0-2d76-4da5-98ed-ef2ce72c83ae.png)



Grant limited access to Azure Storage resources using shared access signatures (SAS), it is similar to AWS S3 pre-signed URL.
Both of those features allow anyone (with whom shared link was shared) to download or upload a file. This feature is very useful when you want to temporary share a file with some user(s) or to allow them to upload a file, without sharing your credentials (temporary creds, creating an account, etc).


# Azure Files

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36766101/218239041-00a549d4-554a-47f9-bee2-1516501a3e50.png)

One fundamental building block of Microsoft’s Azure storage services is Storage Accounts, which are top-level resources that represent a shared pool of storage. These resources offer table, queue, and blob storage for an application’s persistent storage requirements.Azure files allowing access to file storage with the Server Message Block (SMB) and Network File System (NFS) protocols used in traditional file system infrastructure.

# Azure virtual network
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36766101/218245613-2551e44e-ee30-4203-8a30-6078e20460a3.png)
A NAT gateway can be attached to multiple subnets within a virtual network to provide outbound connectivity to the internet. When a NAT gateway is attached to a subnet, it assumes the default route to the internet. The NAT gateway will then be the next hop type for all outbound traffic destined to the internet.
Virtual Network NAT gateway is a fully managed and highly resilient Network Address Translation (NAT) service. Virtual Network NAT gateway simplifies outbound Internet connectivity for virtual networks. When configured on a subnet, all outbound connectivity uses the Virtual Network NAT gayeway's static public IP addresses.


# Azure network best practice
1 Control public IP addresses,Public IP addresses in Azure can be associated with VMs, load balancers, application gateways, and VPN gateways.A better practice is to put VMs behind Azure Load Balancer or Azure Application Gateway. 

2 Use application security groups,Application Security Groups helps to manage the security of Virtual Machines by grouping them according the applications that runs on them. It is a feature that allows the application-centric use of Network Security Groups.ASGs are used within a NSG to apply a network security rule to a specific workload or group of VMs.
![image](https://github.com/xiongye77/azure/assets/36766101/fcbc4096-d763-4c70-a6f7-96a7fe6ebd2e)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36766101/218248348-4114be25-e09d-4fb3-8d98-a758ace34d53.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36766101/218249082-e59de4df-81a1-4ba7-96a9-55a8720c397d.png)

Application Security Groups (ASG) are a feature within Azure that helps simplify the management of Network Security Group (NSG) rules. ASGs can be used to group related applications together and manage their security together.

For example, you could create an ASG for all your web applications and another ASG for all your database applications. You can then add NSG rules to the ASGs that apply to all the applications within that group. This makes it easy to manage the security for all your applications at once.

3 Secure north/south and east/west traffic.To secure virtual networks, consider attack vectors. Note the following points:
Using only subnet NSGs simplifies your environment, but only secures traffic into your subnet. This traffic is known as north/south traffic.
Traffic between VMs on the same subnet is known as east/west traffic.

4 Filter virtual network traffic with NSGs,Network security groups (NSGs) contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules that filter traffic going to and from resources. Filtering can be by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.

5 Implement an Azure perimeter network.Although Microsoft invests heavily in protecting the cloud infrastructure, you must also protect your cloud services and resource groups. A multilayered approach to security provides the best defense. Putting a perimeter network in place is an important part of that defense strategy.

6 Optimize ExpressRoute routing with BGP communities,When you have multiple ExpressRoute circuits, you've got more than one path to connect to Microsoft. As a result, suboptimal routing can happen and your traffic might take a longer path to reach Microsoft, and Microsoft to your network. The longer the network path, the higher the latency.

7 Implement ExpressRoute for mission-critical connections.The Azure ExpressRoute service extends your on-premises infrastructure into the Microsoft cloud. ExpressRoute creates private connections between the virtual Azure datacenter and on-premises networks.

8 Implement Azure Virtual WAN for branch offices,For multiple VPN connections, Azure Virtual WAN is a networking service that provides optimized and automated, branch-to-branch connectivity through Azure.

9 Implement a highly available Site-to-Site VPN

10 Implement a hub and spoke network topology,
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36766101/218247752-ebd3d9cd-e62c-4804-8e21-47c46bc686a2.png)
A hub and spoke network topology isolates workloads while sharing services, such as identity and security. The hub is an Azure virtual network that acts as a central point of connectivity. The spokes are virtual networks that connect to the hub virtual network by using peering. Shared services are deployed in the hub, while individual workloads are deployed as spokes.

11 Design subnets,To provide isolation within a virtual network, you segment it into one or more subnets, and give a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet.By default, Azure routes network traffic between all subnets in a virtual network.Your subnet decisions are based on your technical and organizational requirements.You create subnets by using CIDR notation

12 Set up a DNS server
Azure adds a DNS server by default when you deploy a virtual network. You can use this server to rapidly build virtual networks and deploy resources. But this DNS server only provides services to the resources on that virtual network. To connect multiple virtual networks together, you need more name resolution capabilities. You'll also need these capabilities to connect to an on-premises server from virtual networks. For example, you might need Active Directory to resolve DNS names between virtual networks. To resolve the DNS names, deploy your own custom DNS server in Azure


13 Deploy Azure Firewall
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36766101/218254964-0fd5e192-76e8-4650-a1a6-3056f6457180.png)
Azure Firewall is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that provides the best of breed threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure.
Azure Firewall is offered in three SKUs: Standard, Premium, and Basic.

Azure Firewall Standard provides L3-L7 filtering and threat intelligence feeds directly from Microsoft Cyber Security. Threat intelligence-based filtering can alert and deny traffic from/to known malicious IP addresses and domains which are updated in real time to protect against new and emerging attacks.

Azure Firewall Premium provides advanced capabilities including signature-based IDPS to allow rapid detection of attacks by looking for specific patterns. These patterns can include byte sequences in network traffic, or known malicious instruction sequences used by malware.

Azure Firewall Basic is intended for small and medium size (SMB) customers to secure their Azure cloud environments. It provides the essential protection SMB customers need at an affordable price point.

14 Deploy Web Application Firewall,

Web applications are increasingly targets of malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities. Exploits include SQL injection attacks and cross-site scripting attacks. Preventing such attacks in application code can be challenging. 

15 Implement Network Watcher,Network Watcher provides tools to monitor resources and communications in an Azure virtual network. For example, you can monitor communications between a VM and an endpoint, such as another VM or FQDN. You can also view resources and resource relationships in a virtual network, or diagnose network traffic issues.

16 Use private link service
Azure Private Link enables customers to access Azure PaaS services and Azure-hosted customer/partner services from a virtual network, improving network security and reducing network latency.By eliminating internet-bound traffic, customers can reduce data egress charges associated with accessing Azure PaaS services and Azure-hosted customer/partner services.

Azure Monitor collects monitoring telemetry from a variety of on-premises and Azure sources. Management tools, such as those in Azure Security Center and Azure Automation, also push log data to Azure Monitor. 

The service aggregates and stores this telemetry in a log data store that’s optimized for cost and performance. Analyze data, set up alerts, get end-to-end views of your applications, and use machine learning–driven insights to quickly identify and resolve problems.

Azure Monitor helps you maximize the availability and performance of your applications and services. It delivers a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. This information helps you understand how your applications are performing and proactively identify issues that affect them and the resources they depend on.


Virtual Machine Scale Sets and Custom Script Extensions
Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. 
The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. 
Scale sets provide the following key benefits:
1 Easy to create and manage multiple VMs
2 Provides high availability and application resiliency by distributing VMs across availability zones or fault domains
3 Allows your application to automatically scale as resource demand changes
4 Works at large-scale
The Custom Script Extension downloads and runs scripts on Azure virtual machines (VMs). 
This extension is useful for post-deployment configuration, software installation, or any other configuration or management task. You can download scripts from Azure Storage or GitHub, or provide them to the Azure portal at extension runtime.
The Custom Script Extension integrates with Azure Resource Manager templates. You can also run it by using the Azure CLI, PowerShell, the Azure portal, or the Azure Virtual Machines REST API.

# Log Analytics Workspace
A Log Analytics Workspace is the environment for Azure Monitor log data.
Each workspace has its own data repository and configuration.
A workspace has a unique workspace ID and resource ID.
Same workspace name can be used within different resource groups.
It can be used to collect diagnostic or log data from Azure storage.

Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) replaces the Log Analytics agent (also known as MMA and OMS) for both Windows and Linux machines, in both Azure and non-Azure (on-premises and third-party clouds) environments. It introduces a simplified, flexible method of configuring collection configuration called data collection rules (DCRs). This article outlines the benefits of migrating to Azure Monitor Agent and provides guidance on how to implement a successful migration.

Azure Active Directory (AD) can play a crucial role in not only user management, but also with application security for Azure-based solutions. When an application is registered in Azure AD and provided a service principal, it can be used to securely access other Azure resources that support Azure AD authentication.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36766101/219020463-72980448-f799-400c-9812-7135341b9226.png)


# Azure Key Vault
Azure Key Vault allows the users to instantly store and access the sensitive information in a secured manner.
This cloud service acts as a single central storage for all the secured information which the users can retrieve using specific permissions.
The secured information can be in the form of passwords, certificates, API or cryptographic keys.

There are multiple ways to authorize your app to retrieve the certificate from Azure Key Vault. 


If your app is running within Azure, you can use Managed Service Identities.(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)
In all cases, you can use a Service Principal; in the OAuth2 specs, this is called "Client credentials grant", or more colloquially "Machine-to-Machine flow".

A service endpoint provides secure and direct connectivity to Azure services using the Azure backbone network. When you enable a service endpoint for a subnet, it allows private IP addresses in the VNet to communicate or reach that particular resource type using the public IP of a resource.

Unlike a service endpoint, a private endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your virtual network. This will ensure no traffic leaves the virtual network and all the communication is private.

A Service Endpoint remains a publicly routable IP address. A Private Endpoint is a private IP in the address space of the virtual network where the private endpoint is configured. Create Servce Endpoint policy to control access specific resource.

# Azure Bastion Host
Azure Bastion is a fully managed PaaS service that you provision to securely connect to virtual machines via private IP address. It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly over TLS from the Azure portal, or via the native SSH or RDP client already installed on your local computer. When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machines don't need a public IP address, agent, or special client software.
Bastion provides secure RDP and SSH connectivity to all of the VMs in the virtual network for which it's provisioned. Using Azure Bastion protects your virtual machines from exposing RDP/SSH ports to the outside world, while still providing secure access using RDP/SSH.

# Azure ADLS (data lake storage gen2)
ADLS Gen2 has significant performance and security advantages for analytical workloads
Both the object store model (such as Azure blob storage) and the hierarchical file system model (ADLS Gen1 and Gen2) are compatible with HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). This is achieved with drivers that implement server-side HDFS semantics to translate into remote storage APIs, allowing ADLS Gen2 to behave very similarly to native HDFS.

Active geo-replication is designed as a business continuity solution that allows you to create readable secondary databases of individual databases on a server in the same or different data center (region). Auto-failover groups allow you to manage replication and failover of a group of databases on a server or all databases in a managed instance to another region.
In active geo-replication is on Database level and can have up to 4 secondaries. The Failover Groups are on server level and can only have one copy in a different region.
Geo Replication is used for only Azure SQL Database but Failover groups is applicable to both Azure SQL DB and Azure SQL DB managed instance.

If your organization has many Azure subscriptions, you may need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Management groups provide a governance scope above subscriptions. You organize subscriptions into management groups; the governance conditions you apply cascade by inheritance to all associated subscriptions.

Lock Prevails: If a resource lock is present and denies the specific action (e.g., a CanNotDelete lock for a delete operation, or a ReadOnly lock for any modification/deletion), the operation fails, even if the user is an Owner or User Access Administrator for that resource.
